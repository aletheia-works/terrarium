# Documentation site

Astro + Starlight builds the documentation, search index and aube demo. The
production base is `/terrarium/`. English content initially follows the existing
repository documentation.

Use `mise run site:build` after preparing the fixed formicarium inputs and
package dependencies. It installs this package with its frozen lockfile, runs
`astro check`, builds the documentation separately from the verified `/web/`
assets, then commits the whole local candidate in one transaction. Pages and PR
browser acceptance use the same assembly task.

Content lives in `src/content/docs/`. Dedicated demo routes live in
`src/pages/demos/` and reuse the published terminal element, catalog and runtime
under `/web/`. Do not import the browser-only terminal into Astro's server build.

The Service Worker is copied from the existing vendored `web/coi-serviceworker.js`
to the site root during assembly. A demo registers it for `/terrarium/`, covering
both the page and the shared runtime Workers. A narrower demo-only scope cannot
isolate Workers under `/web/`. Visiting documentation alone registers no worker
and loads no guest; documentation remains usable after a demo registers it.

Keep `/web/`, its iframe messaging and all existing query parameters compatible.
The root page forwards legacy terminal query links to `/web/`; a plain root URL
now opens the documentation. Demo `run` parameters use the terminal's newline
command format. Never add another Pages deployment workflow for this site.

Biome's Astro support only analyzes frontmatter, so its JS unused-reference and
import autofixes are disabled for `.astro` files. `astro check` verifies the
complete templates instead. TypeScript 6 is used because this checker does not
yet support TypeScript 7.
