# Replace web/dist/ with the published builds: the `builds` branch, which
# holds builds.json and <tool>/<name>/ for every build. Before that branch
# existed the builds lived in gh-pages under web/dist/, so fall back to that.
# Prints `base=<commit>` for the `builds` commit loaded, and `base=` when there
# was none, for a push that must not race another one. TERRARIUM_REMOTE
# picks the remote (default: origin).
